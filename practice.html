       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osun_State">Osun State,</a> Nigeria.<sup>[1]</sup> 
       He was born into a very humble <br>background, (Poor family)<sup>[2]</sup> </p>

<h2><strong>Education</strong></h2><hr>
<p>Enoch Adejare Adeboye began his education at Ilesha Grammar School Ilesha Osun State in 1956.[3]
   Enoch Adejare Adeboye then <br>proceeded to the University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN) in Nsukka but because of 
   the Nigeria Civil War, he completed his first degree in <br>the University of Ife now (Obafemi Awolowo 
   University) graduating with a Bachelor's degree in <br>Mathematics in 1967.[4] That same year, <br>he married 
   Foluke Adenike.[5] They both have four children namely: Adeolu Adeboye, Bolu Adubi (née Adeboye), 
   Leke Adeboye and <br>Dare Adeboye (née Adeboye).[6] In 1969, he obtained a Master's degree in Hydrodynamics 
   from University of Lagos. In 1975, he <br>obtained a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Lagos. 
   He holds a position as Professor of Mathematics at University of <br>Lagos.[7]</p>

   <h2><strong>Ministry</strong></h2><hr>
   <p>Adejare Adeboye joined the Redemed Christian Church of God in 1973 and served as an interpreter before 
      he was ordained a pastor in the Church (RCCG) by Pa. Josiah Akindayomi in 1975.[8] He became General 
      Overseer of the church in 1981.[9] For three years, he filled the role part-time at Unilorin before 
      giving up his university position to preach full-time.[10][11]

      The church which was not well known before Adeboye became the General Overseer, has branches in about 
      196 nations as of (March 2017), including more than 14,000,000 in Nigeria. Adeboye has stated that he 
      aims to put a church within five minutes walking distance in developing cities and five minutes driving 
      distance in developed cities.[10]
      
      Adeboye is considered a preacher of the Prosperity gospel,[12] a claim he does not deny, saying that 
      "Pentecostals have such an impact because they talk of the here and now, not just the by and by… while 
      we have to worry about heaven, there are some things God could do for us in the here and now."[13]
      
      Following new legislation that placed limits on non-profit leadership to 20 years of service and less 
      than 70 years of age,[14] Pastor Adeboye resigned in 2017 as leader of the Redemed Christian Church of 
      God.</p>
